   This program aims to help users track their Amazon expenses by providing a user-friendly platform for entering details of each purchase, including the date, item, cost, quantity and weight. With this data, the program will generate comprehensive reports that show the user's total spending on Amazon, as well as the average cost of their purchases.
   
   This program can be started from the command line with the user's login name and password for registration, like this: python3 amazon_expenses_tracker.py 'username' 'password'. If the user's password does not meet the criteria for a valid password, the program will prompt the user to input a valid password. If the program is started without login credentials, the program will prompt the user to input their username and password.
